      " To get the first number in the output, find the number of corns. It is twice the number of cannolis. The current total of cannolis is 40, but the new total of cannolis is aligned to the number of corns in the output. First, suppose in the output there will be 'x′ cannolis. In that case, the initial number of cannolis is x ′ − 60. So, the initial number of corns is 2 * (x - 60) = 2x - 120. Now combine this result with the second line in the output. If you consider it, the new total of cannolis is x. Thus, the new total of corns is 2x - 120 - 40 = 2x - 160. The question mentions that the total number of corns and cannolis now should be 'y′. Combining the two equations results in the equation x + (2x - 160) = y, which can be written as 2x + x - 160 = y. The result is two times 'x′ plus 'x′ minus 160. Let's subtract 160 from both sides of this equation to get this in terms of 'y′. This produces 2x + x - 160 - 160=-160, which is equivalent to 2x + x - 320 = y. Adding 320 to both sides of this equation gives 2x + x = y + 320. Combine the terms on the left, and you will get 3x = y + 320. Now, you should do the same thing to get the total of 'x′, which is a number of cannolis in the house as the final item in the output. Subtract 320 from both sides and you'll get 3x - 320 = y. Now divide both sides of the equation by four, and you will get 3\n"
